GearRenter
==========

WoW addon that assists in renting PVP gear. This is useful because an item can drop in RBGs, Ashran, or the Coliseum that you already have. 
If you have it rented out, you can just sell it back.

### How to use

1. Open up the conquest or honor vendor (for whichever gear you have rented).
2. Click the new icon to the right of the merchant window (or type the command "/rebuy")
3. Watch as it sells, buys, and then equips your gear.

### Notes

This will not sell gear that has enchants on it.
